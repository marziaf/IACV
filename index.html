            These are code examples inspired by the <a
                href=https://boracchi.faculty.polimi.it/teaching/IACV.htm>official course examples</a> that I
            made by and for myself, but that I hope will help others.<br>
            The examples are not meant to explain the theory behind them, but only to show <b>how to implement</b> it
            in matlab. However, you can find <b>my notes about theory</b> <a

            You may find mistakes, but those are <b>of course</b> intended and they're there for you to understand from
            them.

            I try to be synthetic to have a quick guide to consult, but I also add some applications that I thought may
            come handy.
